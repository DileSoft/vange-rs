[Vangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vangers) is a unique 1998 gem that excel in both story telling and technology. The game has been re-released on Steam and GoG recently and is available to play, yet it feels severely outdated to a modern player.

[Vange-rs](https://github.com/kvark/vange-rs) project is an attempt to re-implement the game by using the original resources with modern technology, such as:
  - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language
  - [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) graphics stack
  - fearless GPU and multi-core use

This blog tells the story of this adventure. There is a few [videos on PeerTube](https://peertube.fidonet.io/video-channels/vangers_dev/videos) to watch. Finally, check out [Rusty Vangers on Itch.io](https://kvark.itch.io/vangers)!
